      <h2>Chicken Curry</h2>
      <p>Chicken curry is a dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is common in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, 
          Great Britain, and the Caribbean. A typical curry from the Indian subcontinent consists of chicken stewed in an onion- 
          and tomato-based sauce, flavoured with ginger, garlic, tomato puree, chilli peppers and a variety of spices, 
          often including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and cardamom. Outside of South Asia, chicken curry is often made 
          with a pre-made spice mixture known as curry powder.</p>
